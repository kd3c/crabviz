1. Project Snapshot

Project name:
Crabviz (CLI + VS Code extension)

Goal / North Star Objective:
Provide fast, language-aware, multi-root call & dependency visualization (imports + symbol & function calls) for large polyglot codebases with clear provenance and controllable depth.

Current scope:
* TS/JS + Python file-level import graph.
* Python static function-level call extraction (intra-module simple & self calls) collapsed to file-level or shown symbol-level in UI export.
* Multi-root static scan merged (per-root analyzer runs combined).
* UI export (file & symbol) with depth control, import edge hiding, DOT export.

Out of scope:
* Full Python dynamic / reflection handling.
* Precise runtime resolution (only static heuristics planned).
* Non-Python/TS languages beyond existing stubs (Go/Rust placeholders present in core Rust crate but not integrated in CLI pipeline yet).

2. Architecture & Components

Core modules:
cli.ts: Orchestrates graph build, flags, rendering (status: active, evolving).
lang-py.ts: Python import scanning + static analyzer integration & multi-root merge (status: stage 2 â†’ transitioning to stage 3 planning).
scripts/py_callscan.py: Stage 1 static analyzer (intra-module functions & calls) (status: stable baseline).
static-py.ts: Reconstruct symbol graph from analyzer JSON (status: added dedupe; will expand for provenance & cross-root edges).
ui-symbol-graph.ts: LSP-based symbol graph + call hierarchy (TS/Py via LSP when available) (status: operative; limited Python due to LSP gaps).
ui-file-graph.ts & export-html.ts: Visualization (status: stable; candidate for legend & provenance overlays).
graph.ts: DOT emitter & styling (status: stable; will gain provenance styling classes).
bench-py.ts: Performance harness for analyzer workers (status: initial; optional).

Tech stack:
Languages: TypeScript (CLI & UI builder), Python (static analysis script), Rust (core/lib foundation not yet wired into CLI), HTML/SVG/CSS (render output).
Frameworks: LSP protocol clients (pyright, typescript-language-server), Graphviz via @viz-js/viz.
Databases: None (JSON cache planned).
Infrastructure: Local execution; no external services.

3. Conventions & Standards

Naming conventions:
Python â†’ snake_case
Node.js â†’ camelCase
Files/folders â†’ kebab-case (CLI) or existing repo style preserved.

Formatting:
* TypeScript: tsc + existing style (no enforced formatter yet).
* Python: Minimal; keep analyzer readable (future: black optional).

Logging:
* Feature flags via env: CRV_DEBUG=py|sym, etc.
* Console stderr for progress; quiet flag suppresses.

Testing:
* Manual CLI invocations + test-data sample Python packages.
* Future: add Jest tests for graph shaping & Python JSON fixture validation.

4. Invariants (Must Always Hold True)

* No new external libraries without explicit approval.
* Respect file paths and naming from repo.
* No fabricated APIs, endpoints, or configs.
* Security baseline: no arbitrary code execution beyond controlled analyzer; no network calls unless LSP; sanitize file paths in output; avoid leaking env variables.

5. Rubric & Evaluation Weights
Dimension	Weight	Notes
Correctness	0.35	Must compile/run
Alignment	0.25	Fit repo, naming, arch
Clarity	0.10	Clean + minimal
Maintainability	0.15	Modular, testable
Performance	0.08	Efficient
Safety	0.05	Error handling, auth
Cost	0.02	Avoid bloat

6. Assumption Ledger

VERIFIED:
Static analyzer Stage 1 resolves only intra-module simple & self calls â†’ confirmed via py_callscan.py code.
Multi-root call edges previously missing because analyzer ran only once â†’ confirmed by change & increased edge count.
LSP Python call hierarchy insufficient for deep coverage â†’ observed earlier (few or no edges from pyright).

PENDING:
Cross-root calls largely appear via imported alias/attribute patterns; we assume moderate alias variety (needs confirmation with larger samples).
Users need provenance filtering (import vs static-py vs lsp) â†’ not yet confirmed by users.

REMOVED:
Assumption that single-root scanning acceptable â†’ superseded by multi-root requirement.
Assumption that file-level only depth control sufficient â†’ symbol-level depth needed & implemented.

7. Decisions Log

2025-08-xx â€” Adopt static Python analyzer to replace weak LSP call hierarchy for Python.
2025-08-xx â€” Introduce --call-depth replacing deprecated --max-depth.
2025-08-xx â€” Add --hide-imports & DOT export for debugging.
2025-09-02 â€” Multi-root static analysis merging implemented.
2025-09-02 â€” Symbol-level relation dedup for static analyzer output added.
2025-09-02 â€” Depth control applied to simplified UI export.

8. Open Questions

How aggressive should cross-root resolution heuristics be before risking false positives?
Do we surface unresolved_calls visually (dashed edges) or keep them hidden until confidence tagging is added?
Should Rust core be leveraged for performance-critical graph operations now or later?

9. Next Milestones

Milestone 1: Cross-root import-aware resolution (Phase A) (ETA 2025-09-05, owner: CLI) â€” map imports & from-import names to modules; resolve calls to imported names & attribute calls on imported module aliases (simple attr).
Milestone 2: Attribute chain & alias propagation (Phase B) (ETA 2025-09-09) â€” handle module.sub.func, re-exported names, relative imports.
Milestone 3: Confidence & provenance tagging (Phase C) (ETA 2025-09-11) â€” edge provenance (static-intra, static-cross, lsp, import) + optional legend & filters.
Milestone 4: Incremental cache (Phase D) (ETA 2025-09-13) â€” per-file hash cache storing resolved cross-root edges & invalidation.
Milestone 5: Unresolved diagnostics overlay (Phase E) (ETA 2025-09-15) â€” dashed edges or sidebar counts, toggleable.
Milestone 6: Performance tuning & worker scaling benchmarks (Phase F) (ETA 2025-09-18) â€” auto worker count, profiling large roots.

code_lv: 2
Candidates / Iterations: 1 / 3
Debug: false

Cross-Root Call Resolution Plan (Detailed):

Phase A (Immediate):
1. Extend analyzer to emit import table per module: aliases (import x as a), from-import symbols, relative imports resolved to module path.
2. Build global module->file map (already partially present) across all roots.
3. Build index: symbol simple name -> list of qualified functions (limit by exported module if from-import used).
4. During call collection, for each unresolved simple name in a module:
   * If name in from-import set: direct map to imported module symbol (module.name) â†’ add cross-file edge.
   * If call is Attribute (alias.func()) where alias is imported module alias: map to module.func if present.
5. Tag new edges provenance=static-cross; record resolution mode for confidence scoring.

Phase B:
1. Handle nested attributes: alias.sub.func (resolve alias.sub as submodule path if directory present).
2. Relative import resolution for from .pkg import name (already partially handled in import scanner; integrate into symbol mapping for cross-root linking).
3. Basic re-export detection: if module's __all__ present (optional future) or star-import fallback.

Phase C:
1. Confidence scoring: direct import match (high), alias attribute (medium), heuristic name match (low).
2. Add CLI filters: --edge-provenance include list; legend in HTML.

Phase D:
1. Introduce cache file (.crabviz-pycache.json) storing per-file: hash + resolved functions + edges + import table.
2. On run, skip parsing & re-resolution for unchanged files; only re-link edges referencing changed imports.

Phase E:
1. Optionally emit unresolved edges as dashed gray when --show-unresolved.
2. Provide per-file unresolved summary to aid heuristic tuning.

Phase F:
1. Optimize traversal & resolution loops; parallelize with ThreadPoolExecutor for resolution pass.
2. Provide metrics JSON (counts, time per phase).

Risk Mitigation:
* Begin with precise only (import-backed) matches to avoid false edges.
* Keep heuristic-only matches disabled unless --allow-heuristic specified.
* Provenance & confidence allow UI filtering if noise arises.

Done So Far (Recap):
* Stage 1 analyzer, import scanning, static intra-module calls.
* File & symbol UI exports, depth control, multi-root merging, dedup, DOT export.
* Benchmark harness & multi-root improvements.

Pending Implementation Start: Phase A.
